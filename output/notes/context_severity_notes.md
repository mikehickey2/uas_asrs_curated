## Figure 4: NMAC Prevalence by Flight Phase

- Shows proportion of reports tagged NMAC for each flight phase.
- Arrival and enroute phases show higher NMAC prevalence.
- Unknown phase captures reports where phase could not be parsed.

---

## Figure 5: NMAC Prevalence by Detector

- Shows which detection sources are associated with NMAC-tagged reports.
- Flight crew detection dominates, reflecting the reporter population.
- ATC and other sources appear with varying NMAC rates.

---

## Figure 6: NMAC Prevalence by Time of Day

- Shows NMAC prevalence across local time blocks.
- Midday/afternoon blocks have the most reports.
- Interpret time patterns cautiously given small sample sizes.

## Important Caveats

- **Not population rates**: Report-coded tags in a curated sample of 50 reports; not population incidence rates.

- **Small group suppression**: Groups with n < 5 excluded from figures. All groups remain in Table 4 with plot_included = FALSE.

- **Confidence intervals**: Wilson 95% CIs reflect sampling uncertainty
  but do not account for selection bias in the curated sample.
