## Figure 1: Event Detection by Flight Phase

- **Question**: Who detects UAS encounters, and during which flight phases
  do they occur?

- **Denominators**: N = 50 total reports. Detector field available for 47 reports; phase available for 47 reports. 'Unknown' indicates missing or not reported values.

- **Key finding**: The distribution shows which detection sources and flight
  phases are most represented in this curated sample. Counts are small and
  should not be interpreted as population rates.

## Figure 2: Severity Marker Prevalence

- **Question**: How frequently do NMAC events, evasive actions, and ATC
  assistance appear in the curated UAS encounter reports?

- **Denominators**: N = 50 reports with complete data for all markers (n_available = 50). Wilson 95% confidence intervals reflect sampling uncertainty.

- **Key finding**: Nearly half of reports contain NMAC tags, while evasive
  actions and ATC assistance are less common. Wide confidence intervals
  reflect the small sample size.

## Figure 3: Top Tags in Event Narratives

- **Question**: What anomaly types and contributing factors are most
  frequently tagged in UAS encounter reports?

- **Denominators**: N = 50 reports. Anomaly field present in 50 reports; contributing factors field present in 50 reports. Counts are report-level (each tag counted once per report regardless of repetition).

- **Key finding**: Procedural deviations and airspace violations dominate
  the anomaly tags. Human factors appears in the majority of contributing
  factor tags. These patterns describe the curated sample and should not be
  generalized to all UAS encounters.
