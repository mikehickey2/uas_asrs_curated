## Denominator Notes

- **N total**: 50 UAS encounter reports

- **Variable-level availability (n_available)** differs across fields due to
  missingness in the original ASRS data and parsing limitations for derived
  variables (e.g., miss distance extraction depends on string format).

- **Tag and flag variables** reflect report-coded presence, not population
  incidence rates. These are descriptive frequencies from a curated sample,
  not inferential estimates.

- **Miss distance findings** are based on the subset of reports where
  horizontal and/or vertical distance values could be parsed from the
  events__miss_distance field. Findings may not generalize to reports
  without parseable distance information.

- **Confidence intervals** (Wilson method) reflect uncertainty from small
  sample size and should be interpreted cautiously. They do not account for
  potential selection bias in the curated sample.
