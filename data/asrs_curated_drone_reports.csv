We are self-reporting this oversight; which highlighted the need to reinforce airspace awareness during operations. Moving forward this will directly impact our operations by adding redundant airspace verification's into our process.  The vast majority of the sites previously scanned in the area were in uncontrolled airspace; leading to complacency of controlled airspace verification. We had a Visual Observer during the entirety of the operation and verified no aircraft operating in the vicinity of the scan.

After speaking I began to set up the equipment; verify that my airspace authorization was still valid; perform a site safety assessment; check weather; fill out paperwork and preflight my aircraft. The DJI Phantom 4 that I operate requires an aftermarket remote ID. The make of the remote ID is Holy Stone.  In accordance with my operation and requirements I attached the remote ID module and pressed the power button.  After thoroughly going over all my other items I checked that the area was clear and I launched.  The max flight altitude was 245 feet and it varied for the operation to get videos and stills but never exceeded 245. Max distance from my station at one point was roughly 400 feet. The aircraft was always within visual line of sight.  The aircraft was operating near a road and an active construction site.  Care was taken not to directly overfly people or moving vehicles.  The flight went well; no issues at all. After landing it didn't appear that the remote ID light was on. The battery was fully charged. I cycled the power button on the unit and got a green indication. I'm not sure if the remote ID was not powered on before flight; if it turned off during flight; or if it was on and I just couldn't see the light in the bright sunlight. Weather was clear; very light winds and very bright morning sunlight.  Moving forward I will verify the remote ID is on by covering the unit to ensure I see the status light. I will also try to avoid the direct sunlight when preflighting and remove tinted safety glasses. My recommendation for the remote ID units is to not only have a brighter status light but also a tone when the power button is pressed to indicate the unit has received the command. I could see this being useful with any Remote ID Module. I may suggest this to the manufacturer.","The reporter indicated they were still unsure if the Remote ID module was transmitting or not. There is no way to check after the fact with this module. This is not a known issue and the reporter did not find any other data with similar incidents.",,,"Part 107 UAS pilot reported an uneventful flight but was not sure if the Remote ID Broadcast Module was turned on.",

The FAA airspace authorization was for a maximum altitude of 50ft AGL. The RPIC noticed the climb and immediately took manual control of the aircraft and returned the aircraft to the ground. The UAS was above 50ft for less than five seconds.After the UAS was returned to the ground the PIC investigated how the breach occurred and discovered that the ground control software had two separate maximum altitude limits. One for autonomous flight; and one for manual flight. The manual flight limit was set correctly at 49ft; while the autonomous flight limit was left at 400ft AGL. During a review of procedures and settings; it was noted that this difference is not highlighted in any of the quick reference manuals that come with the UAS. Instead; it is buried in the manual for the ground control software. Internal procedures and trainings have been adjusted to note this difference with the intention to avoid any incursions with this specific aircraft.","Reporter stated the inspection is performed outdoors by Part 107 Operators.

I was PF on LOC and GS for 30L going into SJC. If I recall correctly; just prior to the FO calling '1000' I noticed an anomalous red light appear out of the PAPI and rapidly move towards the aircraft. Within 2 seconds of observing the new light it passed over the left wing at roughly eye level (roughly cabin window height). Light conditions were challenging for visual observation. The sun had already gone below the horizon to our left but enough red/orange light was still present in a narrow band above the terrain to the left that I could observe some glossy shine off the edges of the object in addition to the red light on it. The terrain and city below and in front of us was visually presenting as night conditions (black with lights). Other than the narrow band of light over the terrain on our left; the sky was also presenting as night. With that small amount of light it wasn't possible to quickly ascertain details about the object; other than the relative size; shape; and movement in relation to our jet. I ascertained almost immediately upon seeing it that its relative movement in relation to our glide path was slightly to the left; so it was not coming directly at our fuselage and would pass to our left. In the next second it did indeed pass to my left at eye level and I visually tracked it as it passed over the top of our left wing. It was roughly 2-3 feet in diameter; symmetrical width and length (squarish or roundish in overall shape) and much shorter in height than it was in length or width.

I was able to gain control once I cross the parking lot and could see what the telemetry was saying. The GPS vertical position glitched out and the automated mission; along with the Loiter mode(which is GPS based) thought the drone was falling; so it commanded the drone to throttle up to full throttle for around 30 seconds.  After 30 seconds of trying to control it in loiter mode; I flipped it into Altitude Hold mode; based on barometer; and then I could see the telemetry vertical speed stabilize. Now that I had control with Alt Hold mode; telemetry feed; and even a live video feed; I could navigate the drone back to being over our parking lot and eventually down to land. looking back at the video footage; the barometer said that it was able 1800 meters once stabilized; and then 1000 meters once landed.

Two flights were planned; the first approximately 2 hours before sunset (XA:33 Hours); utilizing a DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise. An autonomous flight plan was created; capturing RGB images along parallel flight lines oriented 258/78 degrees with a 90% overlap directly over the hotel property at approximately 165' AGL altitude. Upon completion of the autonomous portion of the flight; oblique images were captured by manual flight around the property's perimeter. The UAS captured images with the camera angled at 45 degrees and oriented towards the building throughout the flight while manually flying around the entire perimeter at 5-7 MPH. Upon completing the perimeter flight/oblique image capture; the UAS pilot decided to execute a second autonomous flight; adjusting the UAS speed to 9 MPH vs 15 MPH of the first autonomous flight. All three of these flights (autonomous flights 1 & 2; plus 1 perimeter oblique flight) were conducted without incident and concluded approximately 1.5 hours before sunset.  The second half of the mission was flown with a DJI M30T; a UAS with a thermal sensor to capture IR images of the hotel's roof. This flight could not begin until 30 minutes after sunset (XB:03). While waiting for the flight window to open; I heard a helicopter close by and noticed it approximately 1/4 SM East; likely landing at the medical center approaching from the south. Coincidentally; I took a photo of the helicopter at XA:48; just before it disappeared behind the buildings. As soon as the thermal window opened; the M30T was launched and commenced its autonomous flight. The UAS was operating at 188' AGL; and the flight was expected to be completed in 7 minutes.  The flight path maintained the orientation of 78/258 degrees and a 90% overlap. About midway through the flight; the helicopter was heard; but it did not sound like it was taking off; or if it was; it was hovering for a period of time. The helicopter suddenly appeared; the drone was on a 78-degree leg and directly over the hotel. The helicopter was on a westerly flight path at a very low altitude and high rate of speed. I noticed dual landing lights on the helicopter's nose were illuminated; which assisted in assessing the altitude and direction of flight. The instant I determined the helicopter's flight direction could conflict with my UAS operation; I anticipated terminating the flight and taking evasive action. The UAS anti-collision beacons (strobes; upper and lower) had been activated before launch; and the helicopter pilot likely saw them. While they did not appear to take evasive action; the helicopter passed just south of our operation; parallel to the UAS's autonomous flight path. The altitude at which the helicopter pilot departed the area was too low. As a manned pilot with several hours of helicopter flight instruction; I understand helicopters operate at much lower altitudes than fixed-wing aircraft.  Remember that the UAS was operating at 188' AGL - but only 90-95' above the hotel's roof.  As a pilot since 19XX; with ASEL/AMEL ratings; and a CFII for 30+ years; this is the first time I've filed a report; and the first time in nearly 3;000 hours of flight time it felt necessary; not because this is sometimes viewed as a way to cover yourself. I'm not concerned about the compliance of the UAS flight - but more concerned that the helicopter flight could have put themselves or someone on the ground in danger if their flight path had been a few degrees to the right.",,,,"Part 107 UAS pilot reported a near miss with a low flying helicopter operating at a nearby medical center.

There was only one other car in the parking lot all morning. The weather was very good. Clear blue skies; 42 degrees; and just a small amount of wind around 5-10mph. My plan was to look for subjects in a forested area to determine the best height and sun angle for RGB visual detection. My subject was about 100 yards away from the home point up and over a small hill and in some trees. I checked my drone for proper arm extension and lock and propeller condition. All was good. I checked the controller preflight screen for height and distance and changed the height in case I needed to fly higher than 400' AGL to go up a mountain. I set it for 600. I glanced at the low battery and signal loss behaviors and did not notice my signal loss was set to hover. I knew; having been up here last time; that there was RC signal loss behind some of the close-by hills but I made a mental note to keep an eye on the RC signal and just fly higher if it became a problem - as I did last time It was nice enough to not have to be inside the vehicle at all so I got my chair out and sat in the shade of the vehicle so I could see the screen clearly and brightly.After getting the coordinates of my lost subject and dropping a pin on the controller; I launched the drone to my first search altitude which was 150' AGL. I documented last time that this was sufficient height to clear the nearest hill and trees and maintain visual line of sight. I was going to flew to the pin using the wide camera. I was able to see the subject almost immediately upon leaving the parking lot. He was under a tree but had on a brightly-colored jacket and was not shaded by the trees. He was a little off from where the pin was - about 20 feet - so I created a second pin for his actual location. I settled on a distance away from the subject to make my circles. I switched to the zoom (zoomed out) to see the subject clearly but also to be able to see some of the surrounding area; I guessed the circle had a radius of about 100'. I flew around the subject manually one time and determined that except for when he was blocked by trees; he was very visible from all angles. It was actually better when the drone was NOT directly between him and the sun because the sun made the brightly-colored jacket very bright and almost washed out. I was able to mostly correct this however by decreasing the exposure to make everything darker but it was interesting to observe that with the camera in auto he was too bright. I then tried the Point of Interest (POI) feature and flew around the subject a couple of times to see how this worked and it worked very nicely. I was manually adjusting the speed of the circle by using the side movement stick. I noted that the actual POI center point was NOT where the pin was unless the pin and the center of the camera were the exact same spot when I activated the POI. At least this is what I thought based on my observations of the drone behavior when I initiated the POI. I flew both clockwise and counterclockwise a couple of times to get a feel for everything and making observation of the surrounding area and what I was seeing. I was not paying attention to the RC signal after the first five minutes or so because it never dropped below full bars. The subject switched to camo clothing as I brought the drone home to change batteries.Everything was going very smoothly up to this point. I hot swapped the batteries and flew back to the coords to begin searching. Again I set my altitude to be 150' AGL from the home point. I could not see the subject at all this time with wide; zoom or thermal. I flew to within about 100' of the pin and circled while I tried different camera settings to no avail. The subject began moving to different spots and I was finally able to pick him out. I had to zoomin a couple of steps to consistently see him well - maybe 5X. I had to add a new pin because the subject has relocated to a different set of trees. I had trouble adding a new pin for an undetermined reason. I also was not able to figure out how to make the POI start at his exact location - it kept wanting to fly around a point that was about 10 feet to the left of where he was standing. I gave up so that I could focus on determining the best angle. I made at least one circle and I'm pretty sure that the center point of the POI was not holding steady. I was only able to determine that at any angle where the subject was not blocked by tress we equally effective at being able to see him. As I was trying to confirm this by continuing to circle using the right stick pushed full left the drone took off and I lost RC. It is very possible that I was changing positions slightly of where I stood but I guess the radio signal was getting blocked by the small hill to the south of where I was standing. Panic set in. The subject confirmed that the drone had moved rapidly to the south and was quickly out of his sight as well. I tried everything I could think of to get RC back but I was never able to re-acquire. I finally checked my setting for RC loss and found it set to Hover. Based on the fact that the drone was one-half to three quarters of a mile from home I don't feel it went into hove mode very quickly but this is just a guess because I was not paying attention to the RC strength and when I actually completely lost the RC signal. Better one half mile that one or two miles AND it looked like - or I was strongly praying - that the controller had the final location of the drone. In my panic and confused state and not able to think clearly I put my faith in the controller and began walking toward the drones last plotted location that it was able to communicate to the controller which - without RC - I felt could be a fair bit off of actual. I had enough sense to lock my vehicle and get the important things inside before taking off. The subject had radioed that he would be leaving his position to walk in the direction he saw the drone last heading. I caught up to him and continued to follow the controller screen. It look bad as we were heading right for a much higher hill in the distance. I was convinced the drone had crashed into the rocky peak. As we got closer it looked like the drone had flown around the peak and was on the other side. We tried to hike up and over the peak but it got steep so we worked our way around the east side to a saddle and the map said I was close and the drone was a little more south and west. I got to where the controller and drone were on top of each other and took a break. During the break looked up and saw the drone directly in front of me about 10' away and partially buried in a patch of crusty hard snow in an 20' diameter area clear of trees. I realized at this moment that I did not bring my phone and could not take any pictures. CRAP! The left rear propeller was completely buried in snow down to the ground but all the other quadrants look pretty good and especially the camera. The camera was up high on the snow and appeared untouched which it still looks pristine! I carefully lifted the drone out of the snow and set it on a clear spot while I considered what to do next. Also did more damage inspection. The right front propeller had the only other damage of having just the tip broken off. The left rear major damage was one propeller broke off (and recovered from the snow bank) and the other prop on this motor had a very small piece broken off near the tip but otherwise was attached to the motor.I did not have a camera or my phone so I was not able to take any pictures of the crash in situ.I am going to guess that the drone flew to this spot and began it's hover. When the batteries got low it tried to land. It got to it's landing height and didn't land because the bottom vision sensor did not know how to interpret the snow and it just continued to fly until the battery reached critical low and it did a force landing in the snow and for some reason it was not a very controlled landing. The ground and snow were not perfectly level but my opinion is that it should have been able to land gently while also level and not made this significant of an impact. It landed ass first and both batteries were ejected but still inside the drone - one almost fully inside and the other half slid out. This was battery pair set 2. Upon testing it has one solid light and one flashing light. I would have expected only one flashing light. For comparison; battery set 1 which was the first used also has the same battery light flashes.I powered up the drone this morning and all systems checked out. I ran the cameras through their paces and they all worked fine.I will be initiating a repair ticket today.After checking the flight log for the crash flight it turns out that after I launched and flew to the subject; and hovered trying to pin his location and having trouble with the pin; the drone made about a half of a rotation in the manual POI mode before flying off into a much larger loop and losing RC so... I am not sure if the loss of RC was the root cause (probably) or the fact that I didn't set the POI correctly due to the pinning issue or some other function for setting POI's.I did not have a sterile cockpit due to having radio comms with lost subject. There ended up being non-essential comms when the flyaway initiated.HP elevation 8090MSL Crash elevation 8200MSL per Google Earth - does not include forest height.Just shipped M30T off for repairs. Day 0 @XD45hrsThere were several things I didn't do once I realized I lost comms with the drone; and that it was set to hover for lost RC rather than RTH. I could see that I may have the crash or hover location. I considered that; when the batteries got low; the drone may initiate RTH and come home and I also may re-acquire the RC. I waited around the area for a while (5 - 10 minutes) and maybe even long enough that I knew the batteries must have gotten to the low point and if it was coming home; I should have seen it by now. At some point I decided the drone was most likely not coming back so I started off in the direction I saw on the RC. I did not take food; water; phone; or GPS; but I did have the RC in a harness on my chest. Many scenarios were playing out in my mind as we got closer to the Last Known Position (LKP). All I cared about was not losing a good drone. I was hopeful that there would not be extensive damage and that maybe it was able to initiate a controlled landing near the LKP before losing power. I just finished recovering the corrupted video of the drone's last flight and it clearly shows the drone flying away and ultimately flying into trees. It never went into hover mode after I lost control. I didn't feel the damage supported a high speed crash into trees but it is clear to me from the video that this is what happened. It also explains why the batteries were not more depleted. It should have stopped and hovered at about a minute before crashing because it should have detected the loss of RC but did not. I will be looking at the flight log more closely... Day 3 Having thought about this and having slept on it I am now entertaining the possibility that this was at least partially a flyaway situation and a failure of the drone to detect loss of RC and initiate the hover.I am trying to find a way to convert the downloaded flight log file from the drone into readable data. When you download about 8 months worth of flight logs (because you have never done this before) you get a .DAT file that is 3.5 Gigs in size. There is software that will convert .DAT files but nothing for files over a gig in size. What I would specifically be looking for is the timing around the loss of RC - if it was detected - and the crash. I looked at the data from the controller that showed the GPS breadcrumb",,,,"Part 107 UAS pilot reported a flyaway that was due to an unknown aircraft issue or possible signal loss.

The Military had taken the Ocean to a configuration that leaves us with one control extension to work all planes into and out of Southern California to/from the Pacific Ocean. South of this only control extension is W291; controlled by Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility (FACSFAC) San Diego. FACSFAC was working a Drone right on the border of their airspace and Sector XY; and never called me with any kind of Point Out; Coordination; or Whisky Alert. The Drone indicated FL186. Aircraft X was descending out of FL190 to cross GOATZ at 160; when it started flashing conflict alert with this Drone that was now violating my airspace; in direct conflict with Aircraft X. I keyed up to give Aircraft X a traffic alert. This control extension is so narrow that vectoring Aircraft X is not possible without violating Warning airspace on either side. Taking ZLA down to 1 Control Extension; where all traffic into and out of SoCal from the Pacific Ocean is Climb and Dive in a narrow extension that we cannot vector in is already unsafe. Allowing the military to run drones right on the border of this airspace; when they have thousands of miles of open airspace; is ludicrous. There will be a collision one day between a passenger jet and a Navy Operation if this does not change; and the quality of 'controller' at FACSFAC allowed to work by themselves does not improve. FACSFAC needs to be held to a much higher standard; and make pointouts on aircraft that are going to enter my airspace. Luck is the only reason that Aircraft X did not crash into this drone.",,,,"A Center Controller reported a military drone spilled out of Special Use Airspace and caused a conflict with a descending air carrier.

In my mind I was anchored to the XXL approach and not considering any other options. I was surprised by the approach controller when he asked us our approach preference; XYR LOC or XYR RNAV. We asked about XXL (as advertised on ATIS) and were told a drone was at 200 ft over the approach end of XXL and XYR was now the runway in use. I wanted the vertical guidance of the RNAV approach but didn't feel we could get setup in time. Our speed and altitude profile were configured for an extended right downwind arrival for XXL. I suddenly found myself on a high right base for XYR. I accepted the XYR localizer approach and that was my first mistake. I started to setup and brief the approach while doing my best to lose altitude and airspeed in anticipation for an inbound turn. I felt rushed but for some reason didn't ask for delay vectors. During my haste to; 'make it work' I failed to note the distance from the FAF to the runway threshold. This oversight negated my stabilized approach plan and caused me to be; 'behind the aircraft' for the remainder of the approach. My speed and configuration did not meet my planned approach criteria or stabilized approach criteria. It wasn't until after we completed an uneventful landing that I realized how far behind I was. We thoroughly debriefed the approach at the gate and resolved to take delay vectors or go around the next time this type of situation presents itself.",,,,"Air carrier pilot reported being given a last minute change to runway assignment during final approach due to a UAS flying at the approach end of the runway.
